# User Auth with Redux

- This is an example on React-Redux concepts. It will help you to understand how Redux works and how it can be used.
- So basically, there is a login page, and whenever a user clicks on the login button, it will authenticate the user. 
- If the user is authenticated, then it will redirect to the next page by updating the state in the store. 
- If the user wants to logout, then if they click on the logout button, it will set auth to false so that the user is not authenticated, and then it will go back to the login page
